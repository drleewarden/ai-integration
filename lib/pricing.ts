// lib/pricing.ts
//
// Single source of truth for engagement names, prices and phase numbering.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// Prices and phase counts were previously restated independently in the
// pricing page data, the Pricing JSON-LD, llms.txt and the marketing copy.
// They drifted: the $2K AI Tools Assessment was added to /pricing and to the
// structured data but never reached the "three phases" narrative, so the site
// simultaneously published a three-phase and a four-phase engagement model.
//
// RULES
// 1. Numbers and tier names live here. Import them, never retype them.
// 2. Never hardcode a phase count in copy. Use PHASE_COUNT or phaseCountWord().
// 3. Prose that happens to quote a price (FAQ answers, body copy) is still
//    written by hand in the page data files. Those are listed in
//    PROSE_WITH_PRICES below so they can be checked when a price moves.
//
// OPEN DECISION: how many phases are we selling?
// The numbering below follows /pricing, which presents four phases with the
// AI Tools Assessment as Phase 01. /services presents a coherent three-phase
// model instead (Discovery, Build, Managed) and its data file exports only
// phase1/2/3Deliverables. Process.tsx, ai-consulting-melbourne and llms.txt
// also say "three phases". Both models are internally consistent, so this is a
// positioning call, not a typo, and it is deliberately left unresolved here:
//   Option A, Assessment is Phase 01 of four. Keep this numbering, renumber the
//     /services deliverables and update the "three phases" copy to use
//     phaseCountWord().
//   Option B, Assessment is a standalone entry product and the engagement model
//     is three phases. Set its `phase` to 0 (or drop it from PRICING_PHASES and
//     export it separately) and relabel it on /pricing.
// Until that is decided, PHASE_COUNT reflects Option A and the "three phases"
// copy has been left untouched rather than guessed at.
//
// NOT the source of truth for: /pricingdata, which publishes a different offer
// entirely (30-Day Pilot / Build Engagement / AI Ops Residency) and is
// currently noindexed pending reconciliation.
