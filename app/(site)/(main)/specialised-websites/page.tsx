            A website is often the first step in a business workflow. If enquiries lead to
            manual data entry, repeated emails or slow handovers, there may also be an
            automation opportunity. Creative Milk builds custom AI agents and workflow
            automations alongside its website services. Integration feasibility depends
            on your systems, permissions and the scope agreed before a build.
